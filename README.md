# Dogs Web Interface - Frontend

This project is a frontend interface for managing a list of dog breeds via a RESTful API. It was built as part of the "Dogs Web API Code Test" to demonstrate full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with persistent data.

The frontend is a React application built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and interacts with a backend API (Spring Boot) over HTTP.
